# Literate

This is a tool for creating literate programs. It works for any language, and generates html files as output.

This is a very early version. More documentation will be coming soon.

You also need [julia] (http://julialang.org/) to run the compiler.

# Usage

This will probably change soon.

```
$ julia src/literate.jl [-html] [-code] examples/wc.lit
```
