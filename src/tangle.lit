@title Tangle

@s Introduction
Tangle is the part of `Literate` which takes a `.lit` file and generates the corresponding code. It must parse the codeblocks,
detect links to other codeblocks, and follow those.

The overall strategy here is to first fill a dictionary with each piece of code, and its corresponding name. Then, we will
write out the code, recursively following and links that are used.

Here's what the structure looks like:

--- tangle
@{Define the tangle function}
@{Define the write_code function}
---

@s

We receive the lines as an argument, and set up some variables to hold the code for each block, and all the block names. Then
we start looping through each line. We use `line_num` because if we report any errors, we want to give the line number of the error.
Then we check if the line is either a codeblock beginning or ending, and if so we add the code for it to the dictionaries.

--- Define the tangle function
function tangle(lines)
    codeblock_use_lines = {} -- String => Number

    comment_type = ""
    local codeblocks = {} -- String => String
    local block_names = {} -- Number => String
    
    for line_num,line in pairs(lines) do
        line = chomp(line)
        if startswith(line, "@comment_type") then
            comment_type = strip(string.sub(line, 15, #line))
        elseif startswith(line, "@compiler") then
            compiler_command = line:sub(10, #line)
        elseif startswith(line, "@error_format") then
            errorformat = line:sub(15, #line)
        elseif startswith(line, "---") and not string.match(line, "^---$") then
            @{Find the block name}
            @{Get the code}
            @{Add the code to the dict}
        end
    end

    @{Write the code}
end
---

@s

Getting the block name on a normal definition is a matter of removing the `---`. However there may be a `+=` and in that
case we want to strip that off too. We make sure to find the *last* occurrence of a `+=` so that a user could have a `+=`
in the name of the code block. Then we substring it off. We also set a flag `add_to_block` to tell the code later on
that this is not a codeblock definition, but a `+=` definition.

--- Find the block name
local block_name = strip(string.sub(line, 4, #line))

local add_to_block = false -- Whether or not this definition has a +=
if string.match(block_name, "+=") then
    local plus_index = block_name:match'^.*()%+'
    block_name = strip(string.sub(block_name, 1, plus_index-1))
    if codeblocks[block_name] == nil then
        tangle_errors = tangle_errors .. inputfilename .. ":" .. line_num .. ":error: Attempt to add to unknown block: " .. block_name .. "\n"
    end
    add_to_block = true
end
---

@s

Now we want to actually get the code for the codeblock. We loop through each line, incrementing `line_num` until we come
across the end of the codeblock (signified by `---`).

--- Get the code
local code = ""
while true do
    line_num = line_num + 1
    if line_num > #lines then
        tangle_errors = tangle_errors .. inputfilename .. ":" .. #lines .. ":error: ".. block_name .. " is never closed\n"
        break
    end

    if startswith(strip(line), "@{") then
        local name = line:match("@{(.*)}")
        codeblock_use_lines[name] = line_num - 1
    end

    local line = lines[line_num]
    if line == nil then break end
    if chomp(line) == "---" then break end
    line = line_num .. ":" .. line
    code = code .. line .. "\n"
end
---

@s

Finally we add the code to the dictionary in the corresponding slot. If the code was an addition to a previous codeblock
definition, that codeblock must already by defined in the dictionary and we add this code to that index. If not, we
create a new slot for the block name, and assign it to its code.

--- Add the code to the dict
if add_to_block then
    if codeblocks[block_name] ~= nil then
        codeblocks[block_name] = codeblocks[block_name] .. "\n" .. code
    end
else
    if codeblocks[block_name] ~= nil then
        tangle_errors = tangle_errors .. inputfilename .. ":" .. line_num .. ":error: " .. block_name .. " is already defined\n"
    end
    block_names[#block_names + 1] = block_name
    codeblocks[block_name] = code
end
---

@s

Now we define the `write_code` function which takes the `block_name`, `codeblocks`, and `outstream` and writes the code,
recursively following links until it is done. We also keep trying of the leading whitespace so that we correctly indent
the code that is generated based on how the codeblock name was indented.

--- Define the write_code function
function write_code(block_name, leading_whitespace, codeblocks, outstream)
    local code = codeblocks[block_name]
    if code == nil then
        tangle_errors = tangle_errors .. inputfilename .. ":" .. codeblock_use_lines[block_name] .. ":error: Unknown block name: " .. block_name .. "\n"
        return
    end
    local lines = split(code, "\n")

    if comment_type ~= "" then
        if not string.match(block_name, "^.+%w%.%w+$") then
            comment = string.gsub(comment_type, "%%s", block_name)
            write(outstream, leading_whitespace .. comment .. "\n")
            current_line = current_line + 1
        end
    end

    for line_num,line in pairs(lines) do
        real_line_num = line:match("^(%d+):")
        line = line:gsub("^%d+:", "")
        if startswith(strip(line), "@{") then
            myleading_whitespace = string.match(line, "^(.-)[^%s]")
            line = strip(line)
            write_code(string.sub(line, 3, line:find("}[^}]*$") - 1), leading_whitespace .. myleading_whitespace, codeblocks, outstream)
        else
            write(outstream, leading_whitespace .. line .. "\n")
            current_line = current_line + 1

            code_linenums[current_line] = real_line_num
        end
    end

    write(outstream, "\n")
    current_line = current_line + 1
end
---

@s

Here we check if the name is a file with the regular expression `^.+%w%.%w+$`. If it is, we treat it as our root, and recursively
write all the links that are in that codeblock.

--- Write the code
found_file = false
for i,name in pairs(block_names) do
    if string.match(basename(name), "^.+%w%.%w+$") then
        found_file = true
        if stdin then
            outstream = "STDOUT"
            print("\n---- " .. basename(name) .. " ----\n")
        else
            local filename = outdir .. "/" .. strip(name)
            generated_files[#generated_files + 1] = filename
            if file_exists(filename) and not generate_files then
                run("mv " .. filename .. " " .. outdir .. "/" .. shift(strip(name), 3))
                moved_files[#moved_files + 1] = shift(strip(name), 3)
            end
            outstream = io.open(filename, "w")
        end
        current_line = 0
        write_code(name, "", codeblocks, outstream)
        if not stdin then
            outstream:close()
        end
    end
end
if not found_file then
    print(inputfilename .. ":1:warning: no file name found. Not writing any code file.")
end
